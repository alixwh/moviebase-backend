### Technologies used
Gradle  
Java 17   
Docker Desktop

### Config properties
```
server.port=8080  # server HTTP port  
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost/postgres  # JDBC url of the database   
spring.datasource.username=${username}  # login username of the database  
spring.datasource.password=${password}  #  password for authentication with Elasticsearch  
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver  #  name of the JDBC driver  
spring.liquibase.change-log=classpath:db/changelog/changelog-master.xml  #  liquibase

This sets the local database as datasource.

### Adding movies to the database
If you want to add movies to the database, then open Postman  
and do a post request to http://localhost:8080/api/save/genres        -to first add all the genres  
and then do a post request to http://localhost:8080/api/save/movies/1          - the last number being the number of pages of movies you'd like to be added to the database  

If you type in a movie in the searchbar that does not yet exist in the database, then it is automatically added to the database.
